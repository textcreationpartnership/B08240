            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Maſſacres and Murders committed by the Inſtigation and
Incitement of Popiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits, are ſo many, ſo barbarous
and Horrid; that they cannot but miniſter Aſtoniſhment to any ſober
Chriſtian that lays them to heart. For who can conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der without amazement
and confuſion, that they that ſtile themſelves the <hi>Society</hi> (and
would be eſteemed the followers) of the ever Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
who is the Prince of Peace, ſhould be the only Boutefeus, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of
Strife and Contention in every place, where once they get but footing? And the
Prime inſtigators, Contrivers and Actors of all thoſe Bloody Maſſacres
and Butcherly Cruelties that have been perpetrated upon the Stage of the Word,
on the account of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſince the days of <hi>Ignatius
Loyola</hi> their firſt Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Can any man chuſe but be confounded, to
think that thoſe men ſhould take upon themſelves the Title of
Chriſtians, all whoſe practices are ſo diametrically oppoſite to the
Precepts of true Chriſtianity? Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity commands us to bleſs them
that curſe us; but theſe men curſe even thoſe princes, under whoſe
Government they draw their Breath: Chriſtianity commands us to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:184798:3"/>return good for evil; but
theſe men return evil for good: Chriſtianity commands to pray for them that
deſpiteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe us, but theſe men have deſpitefully uſed and
bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly Murdered thoſe that never harm'd them.</p>
            <p>Again, the precepts of Chriſtianity enjoyns us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke one
another to love, and to good works; but theſe Sons of Satan (for his work,
they do, and therefore his Children they are) provoke their ſimple and
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Proſelytes to Murder, Treaſon, and Rebellion; which laſt
Inſtance they have too evidently made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. I doubt not, Sir, but you
remember, that about the year 1663, there was a diſcovery of a certain
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt the Life of our Lord Lieutenant (which was then his Grace
the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> as you know he is now) &amp; the ſubverſion of
the Government, and Firing the Caſtle and City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> &amp;c.
And for this, one Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Jephſon</hi> and ſome others were Arraign'd
condemn'd, and executed here. This <hi>Jephſon</hi> had a Son (whoſe name
was <hi>Joſeph Jephſon</hi>) who was ſometimes after his Fathers death
put an, Apprentice here in <hi>Dublin,</hi> where he was brought up in the
Proteſtant Religion, and had his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation in a Civil Family.</p>
            <p>This Perſon the Jeſuits reſolved to make a Proſelyte to
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and then doubted not but he would be fit for their
purpoſe, and that they might the more eaſily gain upon him; they firſt
ſcrew'd themſelves into his acquaintance, and pretended a great deal of
Love and kindneſs to him; by which means he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a good opinion of
them: and the more to indeer their acquaintance to him, and ingratiate
themſelves with him, they alſo offered to help him to a Wife; which was
indeed the only way to gain him: And theſe Factors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:184798:3"/>for Hell had provided one for
him, againſt whoſe Wealth and Beauty he could make no Exceptions and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore readily accepts of the Match. And now when <hi>Jephſon</hi>
thought upon nothing but being Married, there was a difficulty ſtarted that
he was not a ware of, which was; that this Gentlewoman had made a Vow never to
Marry any perſon but a <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> and therefore he muſt
either loſe his Love or Change his Religion: In this doubtful caſe he
repairs to his old Friends (the Ieſuites) and tells them what Obſtructions
he met with, and deſires their advice; which you may eaſily gueſs, was to
change his Religion: For now they open themſelves to him, and tell him that
the Salvation of his Soul was as well concerned therein, as the obtaining of
his Miſtriſs; and therefore adviſed him to heſitate no longer about it;
giving him ſeveral other reaſons to ſway him to take their advice but
whether it were the force of their Reaſons, or the deſire of obtaining his
Miſtris, that prevailed with him moſt, I am not able to determine, though I
rather think it was the latter: However it was, he renounces the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, and declares himſelf a Papiſt; and now the Gentlewoman may Marry
him, and yet not break her, Vow: In expectation whereof, he addreſſes
himſelf to her, and gives her an account of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (as he term'd
it.) But the yong man found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf extreamly deceiv'd, for their aroſe
another <hi>Remora</hi> much more inſuperable than the former. For he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
declar'd himſelf a Papiſt, they now thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſure of him,
and were reſolved in the firſt place to have their deſigns upon him; and
now an opportunity, as they thought, preſented it ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:184798:4"/>
            <p>For you muſt know the Jeſuits in <hi>Ireland</hi> are
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the ſame deſign as thoſe in <hi>England;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Killing of the Lord Lieutenant (which 'tis ſtrongly preſumed they
deſign'd) was a difficult and hazardous undertaking, they agreed to make this
No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <hi>Jephſon</hi> the Inſtrument of it; a Young and Rich Wife they
knew was the Bait that drew him to change his Religion; and they were
reſolved upon the ſame account to draw him in to commit this Execrable
Murder.</p>
            <p>And therefore when <hi>Jephſon</hi> urged that he might be
Married, ſeeing he was become a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> they told him that he
was too haſty: For he muſt firſt do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to aſſure her of the
truth of his Converſion. They told him that he had done very well to come
into the Boſom of the Mother Church, out of which there was no Salvation; but
yet till he had done ſome noble and Meritorious Act to confirm his Faith,
they ſhould hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe his Converſion to be real. They told him
alſo, that now there was an opportunity preſented it ſelf, wherin he
might do God and the Church very great Service, and ſave his own Soul
beſides; and that was, in avenging his Fathers Blood upon the Duke of
<hi>Ormond:</hi> Adding, that God and Nature ſeem'd to have ordained him for
that very work; and that his Father muſt expect no Redemption from Purgatory,
nor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any hopes of obtaining his miſtreſs, till he had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
it; (this is confidently reported to have been the method of the
proceedings.)</p>
            <p>Though this propoſal did at firſt ſtartle the Young man;
yet either overcome by their perſwaſions, or out of a deſire of Revenge,
or (which I rather think) in <pb n="7" facs="tcp:184798:4"/>hopes
to obtain his Miſtris, he reſolves upon this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Attempt; which
was to be done, as 'tis ſaid either by Shooting the Duke out of a Garret
window, as he went to <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> or in the Crowd going
back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in his Cloſet, or by Dogging him when he went privatly abroad,
and then to diſpach him by Shot, with a Horſe well Mounted to bring him
off.</p>
            <p>But after the heat of his firſt Reſolution was a little
over, the hazard and difficutly of the Attempt did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſcourage
him; and then it pleaſed God to open his Conſcience, (which was not yet
quite ſeared,) and let him ſee his own raſhneſs in undertaking to
commit ſo Execrable a Wickedneſs, and the ſubtil Deluſions of the
Jeſuits in alluring him thereto.</p>
            <p>In this perplexity of Spirit, full of Grief and Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he applyed himſelf to a worthy Magiſtrate of this City, to whom he
diſcovered what <hi>I</hi> have here acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with. Adding, that the
names of the Jeſuits which put him a upon it, were <hi>Pluncket</hi> and
<hi>Pourn;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were immediatly ſeized upon, and carried to
Priſon in order to their Tryals.</p>
            <p>I hope Sir, this Letter will not ſeem troubleſom to you,
ſince by it we may ſee, that let men lay their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſigns as deep as
Hell, yet our gracious God (to whoſe all ſeeing eye nothing can be hid)
dayly diſcovers them, and brings to light theſe hidden works of darkneſs;
<hi>I</hi> hope God will preſerve our King, Church and State, and cauſe all
wicked contrivers of Miſchief to be taken and ſnar'd in the works of their
own hands. This is the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayer of Sir.</p>
